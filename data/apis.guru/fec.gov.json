{"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"contact":{"x-twitter":"FEC"},"description":"This API allows you to explore the way candidates and committees fund their campaigns. \n\n The FEC API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific searches on FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly. \n\n There is a lot of data, but a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check out contributor information in schedule_a. \n\n Get an [API key here](https://api.data.gov/signup/). That will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get a key for 120 calls per minute to [APIinfo@fec.gov](mailto:apiinfo@fec.gov). You can also ask questions and discuss the data in the [FEC data Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data). API changes will also be added to this group in advance of the change. \n\n \n\n The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data. \n\n A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations.

This information is organized by candidate_id. If you're unfamiliar with candidate IDs, using `/candidates/search` will help you locate a particular candidate. \n\n Officially, a candidate is an individual seeking nomination for election to a federal office. People become candidates when they (or agents working on their behalf) raise contributions or make expenditures that exceed $5,000. \n\n The candidate endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration [Form 1](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm1.pdf), for candidate information, and [Form 2](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm2.pdf), for committee information.","name":"candidate"},{"description":"Committees are entities that spend and raise money in an election.

Several different types of organizations file financial reports with the FEC: \n\n *Campaign committees authorized by particular candidates to raise and spend funds in their campaigns. Non-party committees (e.g., PACs), some of which may be sponsored by corporations, unions, trade or membership groups, etc. Political party committees at the national, state, and local levels.

Therefore, during the primary season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended. \n\n Information is made available on the API as soon as it's processed.

If you are interested in\nindividual donors, `/schedules/schedule_a` will be the endpoint you use.\n\nOnce a person gives more than a total of $200, the donations of that person must be\nreported by committees that file F3, F3X and F3P forms.\n\nContributions $200 and under are not required to be itemized, but you can find the total\namount of these small donations by looking up the \"unitemized\" field in the `/reports`\nor `/totals` endpoints.\n\nWhen comparing the totals from reports to line items. the totals will not match unless you\nonly look at items where `\"is_individual\":true` since the same transaction is in the data\nmultiple ways to explain the way it may move though different committees as an earmark.\nSee the `is_individual` sql function within the migrations for more details.\n\nFor the Schedule A aggregates, such as by_occupation and by_state, include only unique individual\ncontributions. See below for full methodology.\n\n__Methodology for determining unique, individual contributions__\n\nFor receipts over $200 use FEC code line_number to identify individuals.\n\nThe line numbers that specify individuals that are automatically included:\n\nLine number with description\n    - 10 Contribution to Independent Expenditure-Only Committees (Super PACs),\n         Political Committees with non-contribution accounts (Hybrid PACs)\n         and nonfederal party \"soft money\" accounts (1991-2002)\n         from a person (individual, partnership, limited liability company,\n         corporation, labor organization, or any other organization or\n         group of persons)\n    - 15 Contribution to political committees (other than Super PACs\n         and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership or\n         limited liability company\n    - 15E Earmarked contributions to political committees\n          (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs) from an individual,\n          partnership or limited liability company\n    - 15J Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution\n          from an individual, partnership or limited liability\n          company given to joint fundraising committee\n    - 18J | Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution\n          from a registered committee given to joint fundraising committee\n    - 30, 30T, 31, 31T, 32 Individual party codes\n\nFor receipts under $200:\nWe check the following codes and see if there is \"earmark\" (or a variation) in the `memo_text`\ndescription of the contribution.\n\nLine number with description\n    -11AI The itemized individual contributions from F3 schedule A\n    -12 Nonfederal other receipt - Levin Account (Line 2)\n    -17 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n    -17A Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n    -18 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n\nOf those transactions,[under $200, and having \"earmark\" in the memo text OR transactions having the codes 11A, 12, 17, 17A, or 18], we then want to exclude earmarks.\n\n\nAll receipt data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\nis derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results\nwill default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,\neven-numbered year.\n\nDue to the large quantity of Schedule A filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\npage number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\nthe `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152643,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 43052850,\n    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880619\",\n        last_contribution_receipt_date: \"2014-01-01\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and\n`last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using sort indices (defaults to sort by contribution date), otherwise some resources may be\nunintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices\nare required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the Schedule A data includes many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n","parameters":[{"description":"Filter for form and line number using the following format: `FORM-LINENUMBER`.

This data\nexplains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are\nreported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.\n\nThe data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\nis derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will\ndefault to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,\neven-numbered year.\n\nDue to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\npage number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\nthe `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 965191,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 19303814,\n    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230906248\",\n        last_disbursement_date: \"2014-07-04\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and\n`last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise\nsome resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\nand these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n","parameters":[{"description":"Filter for form and line number using the following format: `FORM-LINENUMBER`.

For example, if a super PAC\nbought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with\nthe expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate.\n\nAn independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication \"expressly advocating the election or\ndefeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,\nor at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or\na political party or its agents.\"\n\nAggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures\nand the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in\n`/schedule/schedule_e/`.\n\nDue to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\npage number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\nthe `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `expenditure_amount`, you might receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\n```\n \"pagination\": {\n    \"count\": 152623,\n    \"last_indexes\": {\n      \"last_index\": \"3023037\",\n      \"last_expenditure_amount\": -17348.5\n    },\n    \"per_page\": 20,\n    \"pages\": 7632\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=3023037` and\n`last_expenditure_amount=` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise\nsome resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\nand these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the Schedule E data includes many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n","parameters":[{"description":"Filter for form and line number using the following format: `FORM-LINENUMBER`.
