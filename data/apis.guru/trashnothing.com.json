        "description": "Defines javascript functions that can be used to validate and submit posts.\n\nThe advantage of using these functions versus using the post submission endpoint directly is that\nsome of the post validation checks can be done on the client side which will be faster.\n\nNOTE: If used, this javascript file MUST be loaded dynamically for each user because the contents\nof the file are generated dynamically based on the current user.  The file may be cached on a per\nuser basis based on the HTTP cache headers that are returned when the file is requested (currently\nthe cache headers specify that the file should expire after one day).\n\n\nThe following functions are available:\n\n---\n\n**window.TN.check_crossposting_restrictions(group_ids)**\n\nChecks for crossposting restrictions when the user selects more than one group to post to.\n\nParameters:\n- **group_ids** is an array of group IDs\n\nReturns an object with three properties {allowed, restricted, restrictions}.\n\n- **allowed** is an array of the group IDs from group_ids that can be crossposted to\n\n- **restricted** is an array of the group IDs from group_ids that can't be crossposted to\n\n- **restrictions** is an object mapping group IDs that have crossposting restrictions to arrays of group IDs that are restricted.\n  It is useful for pinpointing why a group ID shows up in the restricted array so that users can be provided feedback\n  about the reason for the crossposting restriction (eg. a message like 'group A doesn't allow crossposting to group B').\n\nFor example, given group_ids = [1, 2, 3, 4] and assuming group 1 doesn't allow posting to group 3 and group 2 doesn't allow\nposting to group 1, the returned object will be:\n\n{allowed: [4], restricted: [1, 2, 3], restrictions: {1: [3], 2: [1]}}\n\n\n---\n\n**window.TN.submit_post(args, session, preferences, callback)**\n\nSubmits a new post and performs validation checks on the post before it is accepted for submission.\n\nParameters:\n\n- **args** is an object containing data about the post being submitted and must include\n  the following properties:\n\n  - type: The type of post.  One of: offer, wanted\n  - title: A short description of the item(s).\n  - location: A short location description.\n\n  The following properties are optional:\n\n  - content: A longer description of the item(s).\n  - group_ids: An array of group IDs to submit the post to (if any).\n  - fair_offer: If set to 1, the post will be posted with the Fair Offer Policy (only valid for offer posts - see https://trashnothing.com/fair_offer_policy ).\n  - upload_key: The key used to upload any photos that should be attached to this post.\n  - latitude\n  - longitude\n\n- **session** is a temporary object that is used by submit_post to store data about the submission\n  process for a single post.  The first time submit_post is called with a post, session should\n  be a new empty object (eg. {}).  The session object should be persisted until that post\n  is successfully submitted and then it can be discarded so that the next post will start\n  over with a new empty session object.  \n\n- **preferences** is a permanent object that the client persists and modifies based on warnings returned\n  by the post submission process and user input.  Some post warnings passed to the callback object\n  have a preference_key string property so that users can opt out of those warnings in the future.\n  To save this opt-out preference, set the property indicated by the preference_key in the preferences\n  object (eg. preferences[preference_key] = 1).  The preferences object is only read by submit_post and\n  never modified - it is up to the client to initialize, modify and persist the preferences object.\n\n- **callback** is a function used to return the result of the post submission. It is called and passed\n  one argument - an object with five properties {result, message, preference_key, identifier, session}.\n  The result property is a string that is one of: success, error, warning.  The identifier property is\n  set for errors and warnings and will contain a string that represents the type of error or warning that\n  occurred.\n\n  A success result indicates that the post was submitted successfully. Note that posts may not\n  appear instantly after submission because the moderators of many groups may have additional\n  automatic or manual review processes in place that can delay the publishing of a post.\n  \n  An error result indicates that there is an error with the post to show the user and the message property\n  will contain text describing the error.\n\n  A warning result indicates that there is a warning about the post to show the user and the\n  message property will contain a string describing the warning.  A warning result doesn't prevent a post from\n  being submitted, to continue the submission process after a warning result, just re-submit the post\n  (with the updated session object) to temporarily override that specific warning.\n\n  Certain types of warnings can be opted out of.  These warnings will set preference_key to a string that can be \n  set in the preferences object by the client to opt out of that type of warning in the future (see the description\n  of the preferences parameter for more details).\n",
