API Sandbox tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If you would like Zuora to provision an API Sandbox tenant for you, contact your Zuora representative for assistance.\n\n**Note:** If you have a tenant in the Production Copy Environment, submit a request at <a href=\"http://support.zuora.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> to enable the Zuora REST API in your tenant and obtain the base URL for REST endpoints.\n\nIf you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to <a href=\"https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, including a sample product catalog.\n\n# API Changelog\nYou can find the <a href=\"https://community.zuora.com/t5/Developers/API-Changelog/gpm-p/18092\" target=\"_blank\">Changelog</a> of the API Reference in the Zuora Community.\n\n# Authentication\n\n## OAuth v2.0\n\nZuora recommends that you use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate to the Zuora REST API. Currently, OAuth is not available in every environment. See [Zuora Testing Environments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Environments) for more information.\n\nZuora recommends you to create a dedicated API user with API write access on a tenant when authenticating via OAuth, and then create an OAuth client for this user. See <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User\" target=\"_blank\">Create an API User</a> for how to do this. By creating a dedicated API user, you can control permissions of the API user without affecting other non-API users.\n\nIf a user is deactivated, all of the user's OAuth clients will be automatically deactivated.\n\nAuthenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:\n1. Create a Client\n2. Generate a Token\n3. Make Authenticated Requests\n\n### Create a Client\n\nYou must first [create an OAuth client](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User) in the Zuora UI. To do this, you must be an administrator of your Zuora tenant. This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID and a Client Secret. Please note this information down, as it will be required for the next step.\n\n**Note:** The OAuth client will be owned by a Zuora user account. If you want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client, the owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the \"API Write Access\" permission.\n\n### Generate a Token\n\nAfter creating a client, you must make a call to obtain a bearer token using the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) operation. This operation requires the following parameters:\n- `client_id` - the Client ID displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step\n- `client_secret` - the Client Secret displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step\n- `grant_type` - must be set to `client_credentials`\n\n**Note**: The Client ID and Client Secret mentioned above were displayed when you created the OAuth Client in the prior step. The [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response specifies how long the bearer token is valid for. Call [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) again to generate a new bearer token.\n\n### Make Authenticated Requests\n\nTo authenticate subsequent API requests, you must provide a valid bearer token in an HTTP header:\n\n`Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`\n\nIf you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Entities) enabled, you need to set an additional header to specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. You can use the `scope` field in the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response to determine whether you need to specify an entity ID.\n\nIf the `scope` field contains more than one entity ID, you must specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. For example, if the `scope` field contains `entity.1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc` and `entity.c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`, specify one of the following headers:\n- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: 1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc`\n- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`\n\n**Note**: For a limited period of time, Zuora will accept the `entityId` header as an alternative to the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` header. If you choose to set the `entityId` header, you must remove all \"-\" characters from the entity ID in the `scope` field.\n\nIf the `scope` field contains a single entity ID, you do not need to specify an entity ID.\n\n## Other Supported Authentication Schemes\n\nZuora continues to support the following additional legacy means of authentication:\n\n  * Use username and password. Include authentication with each request in the header: \n  \n    * `apiAccessKeyId` \n    * `apiSecretAccessKey`\n    \n    Zuora recommends that you create an API user specifically for making API calls. See <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User\" target=\"_blank\">Create an API User</a> for more information.\n  \n  * Use an authorization cookie. The cookie authorizes the user to make calls to the REST API for the duration specified in  **Administration > Security Policies > Session timeout**. The cookie expiration time is reset with this duration after every call to the REST API. To obtain a cookie, call the [Connections](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Connections) resource with the following API user information: \n  \n    *   ID    \n    *   Password\n    \n  * For CORS-enabled APIs only: Include a 'single-use' token in the request header, which re-authenticates the user with each request. See below for more details.\n\n### Entity Id and Entity Name\n\nThe `entityId` and `entityName` parameters are only used for [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity \"Zuora Multi-entity\"). These are the legacy parameters that Zuora will only continue to support for a period of time. Zuora recommends you to use the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` parameter instead.\n\n\nThe  `entityId` and `entityName` parameters specify the Id and the [name of the entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/B_Introduction_to_Entity_and_Entity_Hierarchy#Name_and_Display_Name \"Introduction to Entity and Entity Hierarchy\") that you want to access, respectively. Note that you must have permission to access the entity. \n\nYou can specify either the `entityId` or `entityName` parameter in the authentication to access and view an entity.\n\n  * If both `entityId` and `entityName` are specified in the authentication, an error occurs. \n  * If neither `entityId` nor `entityName` is specified in the authentication, you will log in to the entity in which your user account is created. \n  \n\nTo get the entity Id and entity name, you can use the GET Entities REST call. For more information, see [API User Authentication](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/A_Overview_of_Multi-entity#API_User_Authentication \"API User Authentication\").\n  \n  ### Token Authentication for CORS-Enabled APIs\n  \n  The CORS mechanism enables REST API calls to Zuora to be made directly from your customer's browser, with all credit card and security information transmitted directly to Zuora. This minimizes your PCI compliance burden, allows you to implement advanced validation on your payment forms, and  makes your payment forms look just like any other part of your website.\n  \nFor security reasons, instead of using cookies, an API request via CORS uses **tokens** for authentication.\n\nThe token method of authentication is only designed for use with requests that must originate from your customer's browser; **it should  not be considered a replacement to the existing cookie authentication** mechanism.\n\nSee [Zuora CORS REST](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/C_REST_API/Zuora_CORS_REST \"Zuora CORS REST\") for details on how CORS works and how you can begin to implement customer calls to the Zuora REST APIs. See  [HMAC Signatures](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POSTHMACSignature \"HMAC Signatures\") for details on the HMAC method that returns the authentication token.\n\n# Requests and Responses\n\n## Request IDs \nAs a general rule, when asked to supply a \"key\" for an account or subscription (accountKey, account-key, subscriptionKey, subscription-key), you can provide either the actual ID or  the number of the entity.\n\n## HTTP Request Body\n\nMost of the parameters and data accompanying your requests will be contained in the body of the HTTP request. \n\nThe Zuora REST API accepts JSON in the HTTP request body. No other data format (e.g., XML) is supported.\n\n### Data Type\n\n([Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and CRUD operations only) We recommend that you do not specify the decimal values with quotation marks, commas, and spaces. Use characters of `+-0-9.eE`, for example, `5`, `1.9`, `-8.469`, and `7.7e2`. Also, Zuora does not convert currencies for decimal values.\n\n## Testing a Request\n\nUse a third party client, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se \"curl\"), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com \"Postman\"), or [Advanced REST Client](https://advancedrestclient.com \"Advanced REST Client\"), to test the Zuora REST API.\n\nYou can test the Zuora REST API from the Zuora API Sandbox or Production tenants. If connecting to Production, bear in mind that you are working with your live production data, not sample data or test data.\n\n## Testing with Credit Cards\n\nSooner or later it will probably be necessary to test some transactions that involve credit cards. For suggestions on how to handle this, see [Going Live With Your Payment Gateway](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards \"C_Zuora_User_Guides/A_Billing_and_Payments/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards\"\n).\n\n## Concurrent Request Limits\n\nZuora enforces tenant-level concurrent request limits. See <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits\" target=\"_blank\">Concurrent Request Limits</a> for more information.\n\n## Timeout Limit\n\nIf a request does not complete within 120 seconds, the request times out and Zuora returns a Gateway Timeout error.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nResponses and error codes are detailed in [Responses and errors](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/C_REST_API/Responses_and_Errors \"Responses and errors\").\n\n# Pagination\n\nWhen retrieving information (using GET methods), the optional `pageSize` query parameter sets the maximum number of rows to return in a response. The maximum is `40`; larger values are treated as `40`. If this value is empty or invalid, `pageSize` typically defaults to `10`.\n\nThe default value for the maximum number of rows retrieved can be overridden at the method level.\n\nIf more rows are available, the response will include a `nextPage` element, which contains a URL for requesting the next page.  If this value is not provided, no more rows are available. No \"previous page\" element is explicitly provided; to support backward paging, use the previous call.\n\n## Array Size\n\nFor data items that are not paginated, the REST API supports arrays of up to 300 rows.  Thus, for instance, repeated pagination can retrieve thousands of customer accounts, but within any account an array of no more than 300 rate plans is returned.\n\n# API Versions\n\nThe Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API.\n\n## Major Version\n\nThe major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently, Zuora only supports the **v1** major version. For example, `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.\n\n## Minor Version\n\nZuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it. \n\nSome fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error. \n\nIf a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.\n\nIf you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.\n\nYou only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the  `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.\n\nFor all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. \n\n### Minor Version History\n\nThe supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.\n\nThe following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a Zuora REST API minor version.\n\n| Fields         | Minor Version      | REST Methods    | Description |\n|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|\n| invoiceCollect | 189.0 and earlier  | [Create Subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Subscription \"Create Subscription\");

You can specify different types in different create calls, but each create call must apply to only one type of object.\n\n## Limitations \n\nThis call has the following limitations:\n\n* A maximum of 50 objects are supported in a single call.\n* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. The Orders feature is also not supported.\n* The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To create objects according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).\n\n\n## How to Use this Call\n\nYou can call create on an array of one or more zObjects. It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of creating each object. The following information applies to this call:\n\n* You cannot pass in null zObjects.\n* You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.\n* All objects must be of the same type.\n\n### Using Create and Subscribe Calls \nBoth the create and subscribe calls will create a new account. However, there are differences between the calls.\n\nUse the create call to create an account independent of a subscription.\n\nUse the subscribe call to create the account with the subscription and the initial payment information.\n","operationId":"Action_POSTcreate","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Entity_Ids_Single"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Track_Id"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_X_Zuora_WSDL_Version"}],"requestBody":{"content":{"application/json; charset=utf-8":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ProxyActioncreateRequest"}}},"required":true},"responses":{"200":{"description":"","headers":{"Zuora-Request-Id":{"description":"The Zuora internal identifier of the API call.

Use the subscribe call to bundle information required to create at least one new subscription.\n\n**Note:** This feature is unavailable if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance) for more information.\n\nThe call takes in an array of SubscribeRequests. Because it takes an array, you can submit a batch of subscription requests at once. You can create up to 50 different subscriptions in a single subscribe call.\n\nThis is a combined call that you can use to perform all of the following tasks in a single call:\n\n* Create accounts\n* Create contacts\n* Create payment methods, including external payment options\n* Create an invoice for the subscription\n* Apply the first payment to a subscription\n\n## Object Limits \n50 objects are supported in a single call.\n\n\n\n## Effective Date\nIf the effective date is in the future, the invoices will not be generated, and there will be no invoice number.\n\n## Subscription Name, Number, and ID \n### Subscription Name and Number \nThe subscription name is a unique identifier for the subscription. If you do not specify a value for the name, Zuora will create one automatically. The automatically generated value is known as the subscription number, such as `A-S00000080`. You cannot change the subscription name or number after creating the subscription. \n\n* **Subscription name**: The name that you set for the subscription.\n* **Subscription number**: The value generated by Zuora automatically if you do not specify a subscription name. \n\nBoth the subscription name and number must be unique. If they are not, an error will occur.\n\n### Subscription ID \nThe subscription ID is a 32-digit ID in the format 4028xxxx. This is also the unique identifier for a subscription. This value is automatically generated by the system and cannot be edited or updated, but it can be queried. One subscription can have only one subscription name or number, but it can have multiple IDs: Each version of a subscription has a different ID.\n\nThe Subscription object contains the fields `OriginalId` and `PreviousSubscriptionId`. `OriginalId` is the ID for the first version of a subscription. `PreviousSubscriptionId` is the ID of the version created immediately prior to the current version.\n\n## Subscription Preview \nYou can preview invoices that would be generated by the subscribe call. \n\n## Invoice Subscriptions Separately\nIf you have enabled the invoice subscriptions separately feature, a subscribe call will generate an invoice for each subscription for every subscription where the field `IsInvoiceSeparate` is set to `true`.\n\nIf the invoice subscriptions separately feature is disabled, a subscribe call will generate a single invoice for all subscriptions.\n\nSee [Invoicing Subscriptions Separately](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Subscriptions/B_Creating_Subscriptions/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately) for more information.\n\n## Subscriptions and Draft Invoices \nIf a draft invoice that includes charges exists in a customer account, using the subscribe call to create a new subscription and generate an invoice will cause the new subscription to be added to the existing draft invoice. Zuora will then post the invoice. \n\n## When to Use Subscribe and Create Calls \nYou can use either the subscribe call or the create call to create the objects associated with a subscription (accounts, contacts, and so on). There are differences between these calls, however, and some situations are better for one or the other.\n\n### Use the Subscribe Call \nThe subscribe call bundles up all the information you need for a subscription. Use the subscribe call to create new subscriptions when you have all the information you need.\n\nSubscribe calls cannot update BillTo, SoldTo, and Account objects. Payment information objects cannot be updated if there is an existing account ID in the call. These objects are not supported in a subscribe call.\n\n### Use the Create Call \nThe create call is more useful when you want to develop in stages. For example, if you want to first create an account, then a contact, and so on. If you do not have all information available, use the create call. To create a subscription, you must activate the account from Draft status to Active by calling the subscribe call.\n","operationId":"Action_POSTsubscribe","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Entity_Ids_Single"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Track_Id"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_X_Zuora_WSDL_Version"}],"requestBody":{"content":{"application/json; charset=utf-8":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ProxyActionsubscribeRequest"}}},"required":true},"responses":{"200":{"description":"","headers":{"Zuora-Request-Id":{"description":"The Zuora internal identifier of the API call.

The following information applies to this call:\n\n* You cannot pass in null zObjects.\n* You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.\n* All objects must be of the same type.\n* For each field in each object, you must determine that object's ID. Then populate the fields that you want update with the new information.\n* Zuora ignores unrecognized fields in update calls. For example, if an optional field is spelled incorrectly or a field that does not exist is specified, Zuora ignores the field and continues to process the call. No error message is returned for unrecognized fields.\n\n## Limitations \n\nThis call has the following limitations:\n\n* A maximum of 50 objects are supported in a single call.\n* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported.

The possible data types are: `boolean`, `date`, `datetime`, `decimal`, `integer`, `picklist`, `text`, `timestamp`, and `ZOQL`. If the data type is `picklist`, the `<field>` element contains an `<options>` element that lists the possible values of the field.    |\n| `<contexts>` | Specifies the availability of the field. If the `<contexts>` element lists the `export` context, the field is available for use in data source exports.                                                                                                                                                |\n\nThe `<field>` element contains other elements that provide legacy information about the field. This information is not directly related to the REST API.\n\nResponse sample:\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<object>\n  <name>ProductRatePlanCharge</name>\n  <label>Product Rate Plan Charge</label>\n  <fields>\n    ...\n    <field>\n      <name>TaxMode</name>\n      <label>Tax Mode</label>\n      <type>picklist</type>\n      <options>\n        <option>TaxExclusive</option>\n        <option>TaxInclusive</option>\n      </options>\n      <contexts>\n        <context>export</context>\n      </contexts>\n      ...\n    </field>\n    ...\n  </fields>\n</object>\n```\n\nIt is strongly recommended that your integration checks `<contexts>` elements in the response. If your integration does not check `<contexts>` elements, your integration may process fields that are not available for use in data source exports.

One of the journal entries has its Transferred to Accounting status set to \"Yes\", meaning that the entry cannot be canceled. The workflow might go as follows:\n1. You make an API call to cancel the journal run.\n2. The journal run status is \"Completed\", so you receive a response of `{ \"success\": true }`.\n3. Zuora begins asynchronously canceling journal entries associated with the journal run. The journal entry whose Transferred to Accounting status is \"Yes\" fails to be canceled. The cancelation process continues, and the other journal entries are successfully canceled.\n4. The journal run status remains as \"Completed\". The status does not change to \"Canceled\" because the journal run still contains a journey entry that is not canceled.\n","operationId":"PUT_JournalRun","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Entity_Ids_Single"},{"description":"Journal run number.

To post a bill run, the current bill run must have a status of `Completed`.\n\nWhen a bill run is posted, its status is changed to `PostInProgress`. Once all invoices for this bill run are posted then its status is changed to `Posted`.   \n\nWhen you post a bill run and query the status of a bill run, you will get one of the following results `PostInProgress`, `Completed`, or `Posted`. If all invoices in the bill run are posted, then the status of the bill run is `Posted`. If one or more invoices fail to post, the status will change back to `Completed` and you will need to post the bill run again.\n\n## Cancel a Bill Run\n\nCanceling a bill run is an asynchronous operation. When canceling a bill run, the logic is the same as when using the UI to cancel a bill run. You need to provide the `BillRunId`, and set the Status to `Canceled`. \n\nWhen canceling a bill run, consider the following:\n\n* Canceling a bill run with a `Completed` status.\n  * Only the current bill run will be canceled.\n* Canceling a bill run with a `Pending` status.\n  * When canceling an Ad-hoc bill run, only the current bill run will be canceled.\n  * When canceling a scheduled bill, all scheduled bill runs will be canceled.\n\nThe Cancel operation may not be successful. Its success depends on its current business validation. Only a bill run that has no posted invoices can be canceled. If any posted invoices belong to the bill run then an invalid value exception will be thrown with the message, \"The Bill Run cannot be Cancelled, There are Posted invoices.\"\n","operationId":"Object_PUTBillRun","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Entity_Ids_Single"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Track_Id"},{"description":"Object id","in":"path","name":"id","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}}],"requestBody":{"content":{"application/json; charset=utf-8":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ProxyModifyBillRun"}}},"required":true},"responses":{"200":{"description":"","headers":{"Zuora-Request-Id":{"description":"The Zuora internal identifier of the API call.

[Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders#Orders) feature enabled. The migration to Orders is in **Limited Availability**. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing as generally available. \n\nYou can use this operation to create subscriptions and make changes to subscriptions by creating orders. The following tutorials demonstrate how to use this operation:\n\n * [Add a Product to a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Add_a_Product_to_a_Subscription)\n * [Create a Ramp Deal](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Create_a_Ramp_Deal)\n * [Create a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Create_a_Subscription)\n * [Change the Owner of a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Owner_of_a_Subscription)\n * [Change the Terms and Conditions of a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Terms_and_Conditions_of_a_Subscription)\n * [Renew a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Renew_a_Subscription)\n * [Renew a Subscription and Upgrade a Product](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Renew_a_Subscription_and_Upgrade_a_Product)\n * [Replace a Product in a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Replace_a_Product_in_a_Subscription)\n * [Update a Product in a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Update_a_Product_in_a_Subscription)\n * [Cancel a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/D_Cancel_a_Subscription)\n * [Remove a Product from a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/D_Remove_a_Product_from_a_Subscription)\n\nTo return the IDs associated with the numbers returned in the Create Order operation, use `?returnIds=true` at the end of the operation's endpoint.\n\nCreating a draft order is currently not supported. See [Known Limitations in Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/C_Known_Limitations_in_Orders) for additional limitations.\n\n**Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same \"Create order\" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action). \n\n**Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if the payment processing fails then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created.\n\n**Note:** Zuora has the following limits on Orders to prevent performance degradation. You can request a limit increase by submitting a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com).\n* Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single \"Create order\" operation call.\n* Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single \"Create order\" operation call.\n* Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a \"Create order\" operation call.

See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance) for more information.\n* The Update Subscription call creates a new subscription, which has the old subscription number but a new subscription ID.  The old subscription is canceled but remains in the system.\n* In one request, this call can make:\n  * Up to 9 combined add, update, and remove changes\n  * No more than 1 change to terms & conditions\n* Updates are performed in the following sequence:\n  1. First change the notes on the existing subscription, if requested.\n  2. Then change the terms and conditions, if requested.\n  3. Then perform the remaining amendments based upon the effective dates specified. If multiple amendments have the same contract-effective dates, then execute adds before updates, and updates before removes.\n* The update operation is atomic. If any of the updates fails, the entire operation is rolled back.\n* The response of the Update Subscription call is based on the REST API minor version you set in the request header. The response structure might be different if you use different minor version numbers. \n* If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, we recommend that you set the `zuora-version` parameter to `207.0` or later. Otherwise, an error is returned.\n\n## Override a Tiered Price\nThere are two ways you override a tiered price:\n\n* Override a specific tier number\nFor example: `tiers[{tier:1,price:8},{tier:2,price:6}]`\n\n* Override the entire tier structure\nFor example:  `tiers[{tier:1,price:8,startingUnit:1,endingUnit:100,priceFormat:\"FlatFee\"},\n{tier:2,price:6,startingUnit:101,priceFormat:\"FlatFee\"}]`\n\nIf you just override a specific tier, do not include the `startingUnit` field in the request.\n","operationId":"PUT_Subscription","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Entity_Ids_Single"},{"description":"\nThe minor version of the Zuora REST API. \n\nYou need to set this parameter if you use the following fields:\n* collect\n* invoice\n* includeExistingDraftDocItems\n* previewType\n* runBilling\n* targetDate\n\n\nIf you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, you need to specify this parameter.

There are no path or query parameters. The data is uploaded using the HTTP multipart/form-data POST method and applied to the user's tenant. \n\n## How this REST API Call Works\nThe content of the uploaded usage file must follow the format used by the UI import tool. It must be a comma-separated (CSV) file with a corresponding .csv extension. The length of the file name must not exceed 50 characters. The file size must not exceed 4MB. See [Downloading the Usage Template](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/J_Billing_Operations/Usage/C_Import_Usage_Data#Downloading_the_Usage_Template) to learn about how to download the usage file template.\n\nAt the completion of the upload, before the file contents are actually being processed, the API returns a response containing the byte count of the received file and a URL for checking the status of the import process.  Of the five possible results displayed at that URL (Pending, Processing, Completed, Canceled, and Failed) only a Completed status indicates that the import was successful.  The operation is atomic; if any record fails, the file is rejected. In that case, the entire import is rolled back and all stored data is returned to its original state.\n\nTo view the actual import status, enter the resulting status URL from the checkImportStatus response using a tool such as POSTMAN. This additional step provides more information about why the import has failed.\n\nTo manage the information after a successful upload, use the web-based UI.\n\n## Usage File Format\nThe usage file uses the following headings: \n\n| Heading         | Description   | Required |\n|-----------------|--------|----------|\n| ACCOUNT_ID      | Enter the account number, e.g., the default account number, such as A00000001, or your custom account number. Although this field is labeled as Account_Id, it is not the actual Account ID nor Account Name.  | Yes      |\n| UOM             | Enter the unit of measure. This must match the UOM for the usage. | Yes      |\n| QTY             | Enter the quantity.  | Yes      |\n| STARTDATE       | Enter the start date of the usage. This date determines the invoice item service period the associated usage is billed to. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. | Yes |\n| ENDDATE         | Enter the end date of the usage. This is not used in calculations for usage billing and is optional. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p> | No |\n| SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Enter the subscription number or subscription name. If you created the subscription in the Zuora application, Zuora created a number automatically in a format similar to A-S00000001. If you do not provide a value for this field, the associated usage will be added to all subscriptions for the specified Account that use this Unit Of Measure. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record.  <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p>  | No   |\n| CHARGE_ID       | Enter the charge number (not the charge name). You can see the charge ID, e.g., C-00000001, when you add your rate plan to your subscription and view your individual charges. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the specific Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. This field is related to the Charge Number on the subscription rate plan.  <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p>  | No      |\n| DESCRIPTION     | Enter a description for the charge. | No       |\n","operationId":"POST_Usage","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Entity_Ids_Single"}],"requestBody":{"content":{"multipart/form-data":{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"file":{"description":"The usage data to import.\n","type":"string","format":"binary"}},"required":["file"]}}}},"responses":{"200":{"description":"","content":{"application/json; charset=utf-8":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/POSTUsageResponseType"}},"application/json":{"examples":{"response":{"value":{"checkImportStatus":"/v1/usage/2c92c8f83dcbd8b1013dcce1159900cc/status","size":316,"success":true}}}}}}},"summary":"Post usage","tags":["Usage"],"x-code-samples":[{"lang":"Curl","source":"curl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer f21f017e4724445d8647b1f0de7ed6f1\" -F \"file=@UsageData.csv\" \"https://rest.zuora.com/v1/usage\"\n"}]}},"/v1/usage/accounts/{account-key}":{"get":{"description":"This REST API reference describes how to retrieve usage details for an account.
