The task attempt has failed if\nthe app's handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does\nnot receive response before the deadline. Failed\ntasks will be retried according to the\nretry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is\nconsidered an App Engine system error instead of an application error and\nwill cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle\nthe queue's dispatches. Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many\nRequests) response from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion\ncontrol to throttle the queue.","properties":{"appEngineRouting":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/AppEngineRouting"},"body":{"description":"HTTP request body.\n\nA request body is allowed only if the HTTP method is POST or PUT.
