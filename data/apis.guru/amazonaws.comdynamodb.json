You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics.</p> <p>DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. </p>","license":{"name":"Apache 2.0 License","url":"http://www.apache.org/licenses/"},"termsOfService":"https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/","title":"Amazon DynamoDB","version":"2012-08-10","x-apiClientRegistration":{"url":"https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?nc2=h_ct"},"x-apisguru-categories":["cloud"],"x-logo":{"backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","url":"https://api.apis.guru/v2/cache/logo/https_twitter.com_awscloud_profile_image.png"},"x-origin":[{"contentType":"application/json","converter":{"url":"https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi","version":"1.0.0"},"url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/dynamodb-2012-08-10.normal.json","x-apisguru-direct":true}],"x-preferred":true,"x-providerName":"amazonaws.com","x-release":"v4","x-serviceName":"dynamodb"},"externalDocs":{"description":"Amazon Web Services documentation","url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/"},"security":[{"hmac":[]}],"paths":{"/#X-Amz-Target=DynamoDB_20120810.BatchGetItem":{"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Content-Sha256"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Date"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Algorithm"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Credential"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Security-Token"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Signature"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/X-Amz-SignedHeaders"}],"post":{"description":"<p>The <code>BatchGetItem</code> operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables.
