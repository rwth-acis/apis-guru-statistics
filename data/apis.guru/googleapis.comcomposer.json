A comma-separated list of paths, relative to `Environment`, of\nfields to update.\nFor example, to set the version of scikit-learn to install in the\nenvironment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation of\nnumpy, the `updateMask` parameter would include the following two\n`paths` values: \"config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn\" and\n\"config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.numpy\". The included patch\nenvironment would specify the scikit-learn version as follows:\n\n    {\n      \"config\":{\n        \"softwareConfig\":{\n          \"pypiPackages\":{\n            \"scikit-learn\":\"==0.19.0\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nNote that in the above example, any existing PyPI packages\nother than scikit-learn and numpy will be unaffected.\n\nOnly one update type may be included in a single request's `updateMask`.\nFor example, one cannot update both the PyPI packages and\nlabels in the same request. However, it is possible to update multiple\nmembers of a map field simultaneously in the same request. For example,\nto set the labels \"label1\" and \"label2\" while clearing \"label3\" (assuming\nit already exists), one can\nprovide the paths \"labels.label1\", \"labels.label2\", and \"labels.label3\"\nand populate the patch environment as follows:\n\n    {\n      \"labels\":{\n        \"label1\":\"new-label1-value\"\n        \"label2\":\"new-label2-value\"\n      }\n    }\n\nNote that in the above example, any existing labels that are not\nincluded in the `updateMask` will be unaffected.\n\nIt is also possible to replace an entire map field by providing the\nmap field's path in the `updateMask`. The new value of the field will\nbe that which is provided in the patch environment. For example, to\ndelete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and\ninstall botocore at version 1.7.14, the `updateMask` would contain\nthe path \"config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages\", and\nthe patch environment would be the following:\n\n    {\n      \"config\":{\n        \"softwareConfig\":{\n          \"pypiPackages\":{\n            \"botocore\":\"==1.7.14\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n**Note:** Only the following fields can be updated:\n\n <table>\n <tbody>\n <tr>\n <td><strong>Mask</strong></td>\n <td><strong>Purpose</strong></td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td>config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages\n </td>\n <td>Replace all custom custom PyPI packages.
